/**
 * Consumer Producer Factory
 *
 * 1. one of producer has acquired the lock, producer is producing the items and as soon as item is available,
      it signals all the consumer threads waiting on the same lock.
 * 2. once buffer is full, producer will go to waiting state.
 * 3. lock will be released after producing the item, so that awakened consumer thread can consume the items.
 * 4. once consumer has acquired the lock, it will keep consuming the items and will keep awaking producer
      after each consumption (because once item is consumed, buffer is ready to be filled by producer).
 * 5. if consumer has finished the consumption, it will go to waiting state.
 * 6. STEPS WILL BE REPEATED BASED ON WHO HAS ACQUIRED THE LOCK (ðŸ”’ PRODUCER OR CONSUMER)
